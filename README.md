Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**


## Where to find everything

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

## Additional content used

### Normalize https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

### Universal Box Sizing with Inheritance https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/
An improved version of the property box-sizing

### Pokemon Api https://pokeapi.co/
